# Game Sales Analysis

## Project description
In this project the fictive online store Ice sells video games all over the world.  
Based on a open source dataset which contains user- and expert reviews, genres, gaming platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data up to 2016 a extensive data analysis should be carried out in preparation for the campaign for 2017.  
For this campaign patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not should be identified, which will allow ice to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.


##  Project Steps
- Within this project the data has been preprocessed:  
     - Filling missing values
     - Cathegorizing 
     - Adjusting datatypes
     - Dropping unusable rows
- An analysis has been carried out:
     - Investigating the platfroms lifespan, behaviour over time, 
     - How different markets influence sales and genre sbstitution
     - The influence of different genres on sales
     - The influence of age ratings on sales
     - The influence of user and professional ratings on total sales
     - How different platforms and ratings as well as their distribution differs

## Outcomes
For the campaign for 2017 we recommend to start a campaign which full fills the following criteria:  


- **Platform**: PS4 (PC and XOne can also be considered)  
- **genre:** Action, shoter or sport   
- **Both ratings (professional and user**) should be collected for (if done) beta testing  
- **Age rating**: M  
But beside of thos factors, it should maybe considered to develop a campagin for a game for the next generation of consoles (PS5 / Xbox X) because the newest verions are aleady 4-5 Years on the market and already crossed their top of sales (at least if the trend is continuing as expected and there is nothing in the data what shows the opposite)   

Maybe it would also be interessting to investigate mobile games which basically killed the handheld platforms around 2010 (except 3DS)
